**Using AI to Support Decisions Without Replacing Judgment**


## Purpose of this document

This file explains how to use AI to **support decisions**, not to make them for you.

Decision support is about:

- Choosing a course of action
- Prioritizing what matters most
- Understanding risks and consequences
- Making trade-offs explicit
- Acting with awareness, not certainty

AI can help you think through decisions.  
You remain accountable for the outcome.

## Core principle

**AI helps you see options and consequences.  
Humans choose and take responsibility.**

If you ask AI what to decide, you outsource judgment.  
If you ask AI to clarify trade-offs, you improve judgment.

Decision support works when AI is used as a thinking partner, not an authority.

## How decision support differs from analysis

Analysis answers:
- What are the options?
- What are the trade-offs?
- What assumptions are involved?

Decision support answers:
- What should we do next?
- What matters most right now?
- What risks are acceptable?
- What can wait?

Analysis informs decisions.  
Decision support converts understanding into action.

## Common decision-making failures

### Failure 1: Asking AI to choose for you

Poor prompt:
> What should I do?

This removes context, accountability, and values.

Improved:
> Given these priorities and constraints, help me think through a decision.

### Failure 2: Optimizing for one variable

Decisions rarely optimize for cost, speed, or quality alone.

AI needs to know which trade-offs are acceptable and which are not.

### Failure 3: Treating AI output as permission

AI-generated recommendations can feel validating.

Using AI to justify a decision already made defeats the purpose of decision support.

## How to structure a decision-support prompt

Strong decision-support prompts usually include:

1. **Context**  
   What situation requires a decision?

2. **Options**  
   What choices are realistically available?

3. **Priorities**  
   What matters most right now?

4. **Risk tolerance**  
   What level of risk is acceptable?

5. **Decision horizon**  
   Is this short-term, medium-term, or long-term?

Explicit priorities matter more than perfect data.

## Core decision-support prompt patterns

### 1. Prioritization

Use when everything feels important.

**Prompt**
> Given the following tasks or options, help me prioritize them.  
>  
> Context: [brief situation]  
> Criteria: impact, urgency, effort, and risk  
>  
> Explain the reasoning behind the suggested order.

**Why this works**
- Forces trade-offs
- Makes prioritization logic visible
- Reduces decision paralysis

### 2. Decision framing

Use when the choice feels emotionally or politically charged.

**Prompt**
> Help me frame this decision clearly.  
>  
> Define:  
> - The decision to be made  
> - What is in scope  
> - What is out of scope  
> - What success looks like  
> - What failure looks like

**Why this works**
- Reduces ambiguity
- Prevents scope creep
- Aligns expectations

### 3. Risk-aware decision support

Use when consequences matter more than speed.

**Prompt**
> For this decision, identify the main risks.  
>  
> For each risk:  
> - Likelihood  
> - Impact  
> - Possible mitigation  
> - Early warning signs

**Why this works**
- Encourages proactive thinking
- Improves preparedness
- Reduces surprise failures

### 4. Reversible vs irreversible decisions

Use when stakes are unclear.

**Prompt**
> Analyze whether this decision is reversible or irreversible.  
>  
> If reversible, suggest a low-risk way to test it.  
> If irreversible, suggest what should be validated before committing.

**Why this works**
- Prevents overthinking reversible decisions
- Slows down high-impact commitments

### 5. Decision justification

Use when you must explain a decision to others.

**Prompt**
> Help me articulate the reasoning behind this decision.  
>  
> Include:  
> - Alternatives considered  
> - Why this option was chosen  
> - Trade-offs accepted  
> - Risks acknowledged

**Why this works**
- Improves transparency
- Builds trust
- Strengthens accountability

## Using AI decision support responsibly

AI output should be treated as:

- A thinking aid
- A second perspective
- A structured mirror for your reasoning

Good follow-up questions include:
- What would change this recommendation?
- What is the strongest argument against this?
- What am I underweighting or overvaluing?

## When not to use AI for decision support

Avoid using AI when:

- Legal responsibility cannot be delegated
- Ethical judgment is central and non-negotiable
- Inputs are incomplete and cannot be validated
- You are seeking validation rather than clarity

AI supports decisions best **before** commitments are made.

## Final reminder

Good decisions are rarely perfect.  
They are informed, intentional, and owned.

AI can help you think more clearly.  
You still decide, and you live with the outcome.
