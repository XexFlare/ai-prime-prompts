# Writing Prompts

## Purpose
These prompts help improve clarity, tone, and structure when writing with AI.  
They are designed to support clear communication across professional, technical, and general contexts without overproducing or losing intent.

---

## Prompt 1: Clarify and tighten
**Use when:** Your writing feels long, unclear, or unfocused.

**Prompt:**
> Rewrite the following text to improve clarity and conciseness.  
> Preserve the original meaning and intent.  
> Remove unnecessary words and repetition.  
> Do not add new ideas.

### Example prompt (before)
> This document is intended to provide a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the various different reasons, factors, and contributing elements that may, under certain circumstances and conditions, result in the process not functioning or performing in the way that was originally expected or planned.

### Expected output (after)
> This document explains the key reasons why the process may not perform as expected in certain situations.

## Prompt 2: Adjust tone for audience
**Use when:** You need to adapt writing for a specific audience or context.

**Prompt:**
> Rewrite this text for the following audience and tone.  
> Keep the message intact but adjust wording, formality, and emphasis accordingly.

### Example prompt
> Audience: senior leadership  
> Tone: direct, professional, non-technical  
>  
> We are experiencing delays due to several unresolved technical issues.

### Tone menu (with descriptions)
You can explicitly ask for one or more tones. If you’re unsure which to use, the descriptions below can help.

- **Direct** – Clear and to the point, minimal softening or hedging  
- **Professional** – Neutral, workplace-appropriate, polished  
- **Neutral** – Informational, unbiased, no emotional coloring  
- **Formal** – Structured, respectful, traditional business language  
- **Informal** – Relaxed, conversational, less rigid wording  

- **Executive** – High-level, outcome-focused, minimal detail  
- **Persuasive** – Framed to influence or convince the reader  
- **Reassuring** – Calm, confidence-building, reduces anxiety  
- **Assertive** – Firm and confident without being aggressive  
- **Cautious** – Careful, risk-aware, avoids overcommitment  
- **Diplomatic** – Tactful, balanced, avoids confrontation  

- **Empathetic** – Acknowledges feelings or concerns  
- **Instructional** – Step-by-step, teaching-oriented  
- **Technical** – Precise, domain-specific terminology  
- **Non-technical** – Plain language, avoids jargon  

- **Concise** – Short and efficient  
- **Explanatory** – Provides background and reasoning  
- **Critical** – Analytical, evaluative, highlights issues or gaps  
- **Optimistic** – Positive and forward-looking  
- **Conservative** – Risk-averse, measured, restrained  
- **Confident** – Clear conviction without exaggeration  
- **Plain-language** – Simple, accessible, easy to understand  

> Tones can be combined (for example: *direct and diplomatic*, *technical but concise*, *executive and cautious*).

### Expected output
- Tone aligned to the specified audience
- Clear and appropriate level of detail
- No unnecessary jargon

## Prompt 3: Structure unorganized thoughts
**Use when:** You have ideas but no clear structure.

This works especially well with **voice notes**.  
You can speak freely, transcribe the audio, and let the AI organize your thoughts without rewriting your intent.

**Prompt:**
> Organize the following content into a clear, logical structure.  
> Use headings and bullet points where appropriate.  
> Do not expand beyond the provided information.

### Example prompt
> We’re behind schedule, some risks came up, the team is stretched, next steps are unclear, and stakeholders are asking for updates.

### Expected output
- Logical ordering of ideas
- Clear sections and headings
- No added content

---

## Prompt 4: Executive summary
**Use when:** You need a high-level summary for decision-makers.

**Prompt:**
> Create a concise executive summary from the following content.  
> Focus on key points, implications, and next steps.  
> Limit the length to one short paragraph.

### Example prompt (before)
> The project has progressed across multiple phases, with several milestones completed. However, delays were encountered due to resource constraints and external dependencies. Risks related to timeline and budget remain, and additional coordination is required to stabilize delivery. Several recommendations have been proposed to address these issues, including reprioritization of tasks and temporary resource reallocation.

### Expected output (after)
> The project has made measurable progress, but delivery risks remain due to resource constraints and external dependencies. Immediate reprioritization and targeted resource support are recommended to stabilize timelines and mitigate budget impact.

---

## Prompt 5: Rewrite for clarity without simplification
**Use when:** You want clearer writing without reducing depth or accuracy.

**Prompt:**
> Rewrite the following text to improve clarity while preserving technical accuracy and depth.  
> Do not oversimplify or remove important detail.

### Example prompt (before)
> The system leverages asynchronous processing mechanisms in order to optimize throughput while maintaining acceptable latency thresholds across distributed components.

### Expected output (after)
> The system uses asynchronous processing to improve throughput while keeping latency within acceptable limits across distributed components.

---

## Prompt 6: Remove ambiguity
**Use when:** Wording could be misinterpreted.

**Prompt:**
> Identify any ambiguous statements in the following text.  
> Rewrite them to be precise and unambiguous.  
> Explain what was unclear in the original wording.

### Example prompt
> We should proceed with the changes once approval is received.

### Expected output
- Identification of what is unclear (e.g. who approves, when, what changes)
- A precise rewritten version
- Brief explanation of the ambiguity

---

## Notes
- Expected outputs illustrate structure and quality, not exact wording.
- These prompts improve communication, not authority or decision ownership.
- Combine with **reasoning** and **decision-support** prompts when writing affects outcomes.
