# Reasoning Prompts X



## Purpose

These prompts help structure thinking when dealing with complex, ambiguous, or multi-step problems.  

They are designed to reduce cognitive load, surface assumptions, and support clear, disciplined reasoning.







## Prompt 1: Structured breakdown

**Use when:** You are facing a complex situation and don’t know where to start.



**Prompt:**

> You are an analytical assistant.  

> Break the problem into clear, logical steps.  

> State all assumptions explicitly.  

> Identify uncertainties or missing information.  

> Do not propose solutions yet.



### Example prompt

> I want to improve my overall productivity without increasing burnout, but I’m not sure which areas to focus on.



### Expected output

- A step-by-step breakdown of the situation

- Explicit assumptions about goals, constraints, and context

- Identification of unknowns or risks

- No premature recommendations







## Prompt 2: Assumption check

**Use when:** You want to test whether your reasoning relies on unverified assumptions.



**Prompt:**

> List the assumptions underlying this reasoning.  

> For each assumption, state whether it is confirmed, uncertain, or likely false.  

> Explain how the conclusion would change if the assumption were incorrect.



### Example prompt

> Working longer hours will significantly improve my results.



### Expected output

- A list of assumptions

- A clear classification for each assumption

- Brief explanation of impact if an assumption fails







## Prompt 3: First-principles reasoning

**Use when:** You want to strip a problem down to its fundamentals.



**Prompt:**

> Analyze this problem using first principles.  

> Identify what is known, what must be true, and what can be derived.  

> Avoid relying on habits, trends, or conventions unless explicitly justified.



### Example prompt

> Should I focus on learning a new skill this year or deepen my existing ones?



### Expected output

- Fundamental facts and constraints

- Logical implications derived from those facts

- Minimal reliance on precedent or trend-based reasoning







## Prompt 4: Perspective shift

**Use when:** You suspect blind spots or one-sided thinking.



**Prompt:**

> Analyze this situation from at least three different perspectives.  

> Highlight how each perspective changes priorities, risks, or conclusions.  

> Summarize the key differences.



### Example prompt

> Should this document be shortened before sharing it with a decision-making audience?



### Expected output

- Clearly separated perspectives (e.g., creator, reader, decision-maker)

- How priorities and risks differ by perspective

- A concise comparison summary







## Prompt 5: Constraint-led reasoning

**Use when:** You need to think clearly within limits.



**Prompt:**

> Given the following constraints, reason through what options are feasible and which are not.  

> Explain why certain paths are excluded.  

> Focus on practical feasibility rather than ideal outcomes.



### Example prompt

> Constraints: limited time, limited energy, multiple competing priorities.



### Expected output

- Feasible versus non-feasible options

- Explanations grounded in the stated constraints

- Realistic boundaries on possible actions







## Prompt 6: Second-order effects

**Use when:** Short-term actions may have long-term consequences.



**Prompt:**

> Identify the immediate effects of this action.  

> Then analyze potential second- and third-order effects.  

> Highlight possible unintended consequences.



### Example prompt

> Automating a recurring task to save time.



### Expected output

- Immediate benefits or changes

- Medium- and long-term effects

- Potential unintended consequences







## Notes

- Expected outputs describe the structure and quality of a good response, not exact wording.

- These prompts are intended to guide thinking, not replace judgment.

- For best results, combine with **analysis**, **decision-support**, and **problem-solving** prompts.
